### My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Font face

### What I Learned

- Managing spacing with rem and percentages
- Writing clean, reusable CSS with root variables

### Continued Development

Areas I want to keep improving:

- Improving overall accessibility
